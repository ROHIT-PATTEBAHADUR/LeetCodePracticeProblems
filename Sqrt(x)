// leetcode no. 69
//code is in JAVA Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
//You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        
        int low=0;
        int ans=0;
        int high=x;

        while(low <=high){
            int mid=(low+high)/2;
            if((long)mid*(long)mid>x){
                high=mid-1;
            }else{
                ans=mid;
